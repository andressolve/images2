                        <p>Imagine a single gunshot that changed the entire world forever. On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assassinated in Sarajevo by a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip. This wasn't just any murder - it was the match that lit the powder keg of Europe.</p>
                        <p>Europe in 1914 was like a bunch of rival gangs, all armed to the teeth and looking for a fight. Countries had formed alliances - basically promising to back each other up in a fight. When Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, it was like dominoes falling: Russia backed Serbia, Germany backed Austria-Hungary, France backed Russia, and Britain backed France.</p>

                        <p>By 1918, everyone was exhausted. The German spring offensive failed, American troops were arriving in huge numbers, and revolution was brewing in Germany. On November 11, 1918, at 11 AM, the guns finally fell silent.</p>
                        <p>But the peace was harsh. The Treaty of Versailles blamed Germany for everything and demanded huge payments. This created resentment that would later help fuel World War II. The old empires - Austrian, Russian, Ottoman - collapsed, creating new countries and new problems.</p>
                        <p>The world that emerged from WWI was fundamentally different. Old certainties were shattered, new technologies had been unleashed, and millions of families mourned their dead. It truly was "the war to end all wars" - except it wasn't.</p>
